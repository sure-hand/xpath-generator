# xpath-generator

The XPath Generator emerged out of necesity to get list of all possible elements in an XML Structure defined by XSD. 
This helps to quickly compare two versions of XML Schemas (XSDs). Particularly where the schema consists of several
interlinked XSD files and one change to a simple ttpe might have impact to many complex types where this simple type is reused.

In this tool we use the icon from http://www.iconarchive.com/show/flat-ios7-style-documents-icons-by-iynque/xml-icon.html
